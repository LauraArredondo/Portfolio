## About me 🙂
Hi, I’m a Manual QA professional with over 8 years of experience working remotely for SaaS companies. I thrive on attention to detail, ensuring that every product I test is reliable. My background in quality assurance has allowed me to combine my love for programming, design, and problem-solving to deliver exceptional user experiences.

I’m passionate about learning, constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects and online courses. I enjoy finding new ways to enhance my work and improve my skills.
Working remotely I have experience in asynchronous communication, I excel at collaborating with globally distributed teams. I’m adept at maintaining clear, concise communication across time zones and ensuring progress on shared goals without missing a beat.

Beyond the technical side, I love the creative aspects of design and enjoy bridging the gap between technical functionality and user-friendly design. My ultimate goal is to continue growing and contributing to innovative teams while delivering quality products that users can rely on.
